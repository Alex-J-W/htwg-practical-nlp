Welcome to the course **Practical Natural Language Processing** at HTWG Konstanz.

I'm excited to have you here and I hope you will enjoy the course.

## Quickstart 🚀

If you have [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system, you can get started right away.

After you forked or cloned the repository, execute one of the following commands:

```sh
# regular setup
make

# development setup
make install-dev
```

## Preparation 📚

There are already a few things you can do _before_ our course officially starts:

- **Enrol in the Moodle course**: 🙋‍♂️

    We use the HTWG [Moodle](https://moodle.htwg-konstanz.de/moodle/) for internal announcements or anything that is related to the current semester.
    This is to make sure that nobody misses anything.
    Also it will give me an estimation of how many students plan to take the course.

- **Check the course profile and prerequisities**: 📋

    Check out the [course profile](./course_profile.md) to see if the description matches your expactations.

    If you decide to take the course, check if you need to catch up on the topics mentioned on the [course prerequisites](./course_profile.md#prerequisites).

    To get the most out of this course, you should have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Mural](https://www.mural.co/) account.
    Both services are free to use.
