# Preface

Before we start with the first lecture, let's briefly align our expectations and talk about what this course is and what it is not.

**This course is ...**

- a practical introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- hands-on: we will learn some important NLP libraries and frameworks
- collaborative: you are encouraged to contribute to the course content through GitHub
- driven by real-world use cases
- a course that will teach you the foundations of NLP and equip you with the knowledge and skills to apply NLP in your domain
- designed for software engineers and we will focus on the engineering perspective of NLP

**This course is not ...**

- a theoretical deep dive into NLP algorithms and models: we rather want to know how we can apply NLP in practice
- primarily about ChatGPT and GenAI: we will cover these topics, but we rather focus on the foundations of NLP
- a survey of the latest NLP research: the field is moving fast, and we will rather build a good foundation that will allow you to keep up with the latest developments
- a course that will teach you how to build NLP models from scratch: we will rather focus on how to apply existing models and frameworks

### The Research Site

The research side of NLP involves advancing the field of Natural Language Processing through innovative methods, models, and theories, requiring a combination of creativity and scientific rigor.

- NLP research involves developing new methods, models, algorithms, and theories.
- Researchers work in academic institutions, research labs, or R&D-focused companies.
- Successful NLP researchers need a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
- They must possess a deep understanding of NLP fundamentals and current trends.
- Proficiency in programming languages and frameworks like Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow is essential.
- Researchers must be capable of conducting literature reviews, designing experiments, analyzing results, and writing research papers.

### The Engineering Site

NLP engineering involves applying NLP techniques to solve real-world problems by creating efficient and reliable systems.

- NLP engineering applies existing NLP techniques to practical scenarios.
- It focuses on building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems for handling large datasets and producing high-quality outputs.
- NLP engineers are typically employed by product teams, software companies, or organizations with specific NLP use cases.
- Success in this role requires a strong understanding of software engineering principles and practices.
- Practical experience with NLP tools and libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, and Gensim is crucial.
- Familiarity with various NLP architectures and models, including BERT, GPT, and Transformer, is necessary.
- Competence in data processing, cleaning, and manipulation is an essential skill.
- NLP engineers should be able to integrate NLP components with other systems, such as web services, databases, and cloud services.

## Goals and Metrics

One of the main differences between NLP research and NLP engineering roles is the way they define and measure their goals:

| Aspect                   | NLP Research                  | NLP Engineering                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|


## Data and Methodology

Another difference between NLP research and NLP engineering roles is related to the data and methodology that is used.

| Aspect                            | NLP Research                                                             | NLP Engineering                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|


## Challenges

NLP research and engineering roles differ in the type of challenges they face.

| Aspect                                       | NLP Research                                                         | NLP Engineering                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|


Both roles have to make trade-offs between generalization vs specialization, exploration vs exploitation, innovation vs implementation, and theory vs practice.
