# Preface

Before we start with the course, let's briefly align our expectations and how we approach the fascinating topic of NLP.

## What to expect

**This course is ...**

- a practical introduction NLP
- hands-on: we will learn some important NLP libraries and frameworks
- collaborative: you are encouraged to contribute to the course content through GitHub
- driven by real-world use cases
- a course that will teach you the foundations of NLP and equip you with the knowledge and skills to apply NLP in your domain
- designed for software engineers and we will focus on the engineering perspective of NLP

## What is not included

**This course is not ...**

- a theoretical deep dive into NLP algorithms and models: we rather want to know how we can apply NLP in practice
- primarily about ChatGPT and GenAI: we will cover these topics, but we rather focus on the foundations of NLP
- a survey of the latest NLP research: the field is moving fast, and we will rather build a good foundation that will allow you to keep up with the latest developments
- a course that will teach you how to build NLP models from scratch: we will rather focus on how to apply existing models and frameworks

## Structure of the course

The following diagram shows the structure we follow in the course.
After doing some groundwork and covering NLP foundations, we will take a look at probabilistic NLP approaches.
After that, we dive into deep learning and how we can use it for NLP tasks.
Finally, we will take a look at large language models, generative artificial intelligence, and the current advances in this field.
