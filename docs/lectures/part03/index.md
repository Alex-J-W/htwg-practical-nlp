# Part 3 - Probabilistic NLP models

This part covers probabilistic NLP approaches, and familiarizes with the mathematical concepts behind them.
This part should get a little more weight, as the statistical methods are interesting, still somewhat intuitive, and at the same time rather easy to implement. 
It will show the students that even with leight-weight approaches, we can solve impressing NLP tasks.
